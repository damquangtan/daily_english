And today's topic is a very important one, Lucas

That's right, Mizu. Today we're talking about feelings - emotions - how to describe how you feel in English, clearly and naturally.

Because we feel something every day, right? Happy, tired, excited, bored ...oh, so many feelings.

Speaking of that, Mizu, how are you feeling today? Like, right now.

Hmm, good question. I feel calm...calm, and a little happy. I had a slow morning, coffee, music - oh, it was nice.

Oh wow, that sounds great. I fee relaxed too. Yesterday I went for a long walk, then I cooked dinner at home. Simple, quiet, perfect.

So stay with us, relax, and let's talk about emotions together.

Let's begin with two very basic feelings - simple, common, and very useful. The first one is happy. Lucas, when do you feel happy?

Hmm, I feel happy when my morning starts well. You know - good sleep, warm coffee, no rush. That small moment make me happy, happy.

Oh wow, I love that. For me, I feel happy when I finish something difficult. When I close my laptop and say, "Yes, I did it," haha - that feeling is happy.

Yes! And we can also say glad. I'm glad to be here right now, Mizu. Glad, glad - it feels good to say.

Exactly. And another word is pleased. I'm pleased with today's lesson. Calm, clear, and friendly.

Right. But for everyday talk, happly is the most common word people use. Simple and natural.

Now let's change the feeling. What is the opposite of happy?

That would be sad. I feel when plans change suddenly. You expect something... and then, oh, it's canceled. That can feel sad.

Yes, I understand that. I feel sad when I hear a sad voice from a friend. Even if they don't say much, I can feel it.

Oh Mizu, that's very true. Feelings can travel, right?

They really do. And it's okay to feel sad sometimes. Sad .. sad - it's a normal emotion, ... not a bad one.

Exactly. Feeling sad for a short time is part of being human. And today, we're learning how to talk about it in English, clearly and honestly.

Now let's move to some feelings that are a little stronger, a little more complex.

Not happy feelings, but very real ones. Let's start with upset (buồn, khó chịu, bực bội. sad < upset < angry).

Yes, upset is a word we hear a lot. Mizu, when was the last time you felt upset?

Hmm... I felt upset this morning, actually. I woke up late, spilled my coffee, and mised my bus. (làm đổ cà phê, lỡ xe buýt).

Nothing terrible, but all together - oh - I felt upset, upset.

Oh no, that kind of morning can really shake you (khiến bạn bối rối). So upset is not just sad, right?
