- And I'm Lucas! Hi everyone! Seriously, it feels so good to be here with you. Thanks for spending a little time with us today.
- And today's topic is a very important one, Lucas
- That's right, Mizu. Today we're talking about feelings - emotions - how to describe how you feel in English, clearly and naturally.
- Because we feel something every day, right? Happy, tired, excited, bored ...oh, so many feelings.
- Speaking of that, Mizu, how are you feeling today? Like, right now.
- Hmm, good question. I feel calm...calm, and a little happy. I had a slow morning, coffee, music - oh, it was nice.
- Oh wow, that sounds great. I fee relaxed too. Yesterday I went for a long walk, then I cooked dinner at home. Simple, quiet, perfect.
- See? Just like that, Lucas. We're already sharing feelings.

- Exactly. Here on Go English, we practice real English, everyday English - the kind of people actually use when they talk.
- Not textbook English, not robot English, haha - real feelings, real stories, real conversations. Yes, Mizu, happy, calm, relaxed - we're doing it - already.
- Exactly! And that's why today's lesson will feel easy, natural, and very useful for you.
- So stay with us, relax, and let's talk about emotions together.
- Let's begin with two very basic feelings - simple, common, and very useful. The first one is happy. Lucas, when do you feel happy?
- Hmm, I feel happy when my morning starts well. You know - good sleep, warm coffee, no rush. That small moment make me happy, happy.
- Oh wow, I love that. For me, I feel happy when I finish something difficult. When I close my laptop and say, "Yes, I did it," haha - that feeling - is happy.
- Yes! And we can also say glad. I'm glad to be here right now, Mizu. Glad, glad - it feels good to say.
- Exactly. And another word is pleased. I'm pleased with today's lesson. Calm, clear, and friendly.
- Right. But for everyday talk, happly is the most common word people use. Simple and natural.
- Now let's change the feeling. What is the opposite of happy?
- That would be sad. I feel when plans change suddenly. You expect something... and then, oh, it's canceled. That can feel sad.
- Yes, I understand that. I feel sad when I hear a sad voice from a friend. Even if they don't say much, I can feel it.
- Oh Mizu, that's very true. Feelings can travel, right?
- They really do. And it's okay to feel sad sometimes. Sad .. sad - it's a normal emotion, ... not a bad one.
- Exactly. Feeling sad for a short time is part of being human. And today, we're learning how to talk about it in English, clearly and honestly.
- Now let's move to some feelings that are a little stronger, a little more complex.
- Not happy feelings, but very real ones. Let's start with upset (buồn, khó chịu, bực bội. sad < upset < angry).
- Yes, upset is a word we hear a lot. Mizu, when was the last time you felt upset?
- Hmm... I felt upset this morning, actually. I woke up late, spilled my coffee, and mised my bus. (làm đổ cà phê, lỡ xe buýt).
- Nothing terrible, but all together - oh - I felt upset, upset.
- Oh no, that kind of morning can really shake you (khiến bạn bối rối). So upset is not just sad, right?
- Exactly. Upset is like a mix - a little sad, a little angry, and a little stressed.
- Yes, that makes sense. I feel upset when someone misunderstands me and doesn't listen.
- Oh Lucas, that feeling is so real. And if that feeling grows, it can turn into angry.
- Oof, angry. I don't enjoy that feeling at all. Angry ... angry - it's strong.
- Same here. I feel angry when something feels unfair. Like when you try your best, but things still go wrong.
- Yes, Mizu. And sometimes anger comes from small things too. For me, it't technology.
- When nothing works, and time is running out - oh - I get angry fast.
- Haha, yes! And that brings us to another great word - frustrated (bực bội, chán nản hoặc khó chịu vì đã không đạt được điều mình muốn dù đã cố - gắng).
- Frustrated is perfect for that feeling. You want to fix the problem, you try again and again ... but nothing changes.
- Exactly. I feel frustrated when I read instructions and still don't understand. I read slowly, I read again .. and still, huh?
- Oh wow, I know that feeling so well, Mizu. You're not angry at a person - you're tired of the situation. That's frushtrated.
- Yes. And then there's a smaller feeling - annoyed (bực mình, khó chịu nhẹ, nhưng chưa đến mức tức giận. Annoyed < Frustrated < Angry).
- Annoyed is like a little itch, right? Not big anger (danh từ: sự tức giận. Annoyed → Frustrated → Anger).
- Exactly. I feel annoyed when a phone keeps buzzing again, again, again. Not angry... just annoyed, annoyed.
- Haha, yes! Or when someone repeats the same sound over and over. Small thing, small feeling.
- And that's the key, everyone. These feelings are different in size and strength.
- Upset, angry, frustrated, annoyed - different words, different moments, but all very useful in real English conversations.
- After talking about upset, angry, frustrated, and annoyed, let's move to another group of feelings.
- These ones live a little more in our mind and body.
- Yes, Mizu. These are the feelings that make your heart beat faster. Let's start with scared.
- Oh wow... scared is a strong one for me. I feel scared when I hear a strange noise at night.
- My room is quiet, the light is off, and suddenly - a sound. Scared, scared.
- Haha, yes, that moment when you stop breathing for a second. You can also say afraid.
- Right. Afraid is very similar to scared. I'm afraid of deep water. I can swim, but deep water still makes me afraid.
- For me, I'm afraid of speaking in front of a big group. My hands get cold, my voice changes a little.
- And that feeling connects to another word - nervous.
- Exactly. Nervous is not big fear. It's that shaky (run rẫy, bồn chồn) feeling before something important.
- Yes. I feel nervous before starting something new. Even when I know it will be okay, my stomach(dạ dày) says, "Oh... wait."
- Haha, I love that. And nervous often comes with thinking too much, right?
- Yes, and that thinking can turn into worried.
- Exactly, Lucas. I felt worried when I sent an important message and didn't get a reply. I kept checking my phone. Worried, worried.
- Oh wow, I know that feeling. That's so stressful.
- So let's connect these feelings. Scared and afraid are about fear.
- Nervous is about the moment before action. And worried is when your mind stays busy.
- Beautifully said, Mizu. Diffent words, diffent situation, but all very real - and very useful in everyday English.
- After all those heavy feelings - scared, nervous, worried - let's breathe a little and move back to something brighter.
- Let's talk about positive feelings again.
- Oh yes, thank you, Lucas. Let's start with one of my favorites - excited.
- Haha, I knew you would say that. So, Mizu, what makes you feel excited these days?
- I feel excited when I have something to look forward to. Like planning a vacation, or even a fun weekend vacation.
- My heart feels light, my mind feels fast - excited, excited.
- Oh wow, I love that feeling too. I felt excited this morning because we're recording together. I woke up early with energy - that's excited.
- Exactly! Excited is happy energy about the future.
- But sometimes, that energy doesn't last forever, right? That brings us to another very real feeling - tired.
- Oh Lucas, tired is part of daily life, haha. I feel tired in the late afternoon. My body slow down, my voice get softer.
- Yes. Tired can be physical, or mental, or both. After a long meeting, I feel tired even if I don't move much.
- That's so true. And then there's a stronger word - exhausted.
- Exhausted is not just tired. It's tired, tired, tired - no energy left (không còn chút năng lượng nào nữa).
- Exactly. I feel exhausted after a very busy day. I don't want to talk, I don't want to think - I just want to rest.
- Oh wow, yes. And notice the connection here. You can feel excited first, then tired, and finally exhausted.
- Yes! Feelings move, they change, just like our day.
- And learning these words helps you explain your real life clearly, honestly, and naturally in English.
- Haha, Lucas, we just talked about energy, excitement...and wow, feeling exhausted too!
- Haha, yeah! My energy goes up and down all the time.
- Same here! One moment I feel excited, and the next moment...I'm so tired.
- Exactly! Feelings can change really fast, right?
- Right! And now, let's talk about some mixed emotions - feelings that change very quickly.
- Ooh, that sounds interesting!
- Yeah! Let's start with surprised.
- Oh, surprise - I like that one already, haha. So, Mizu, when was the last time you felt surprised?
- I felt surprised yesterday, actually. A friend I hadn't heard from in years suddenly sent me a message.
- I looked at my phone and said, "Oh wow!" Surprised, surprised.
- That's a good surprised. And that's important - surprises can be good or bad.
- Exactly. A good one is a pleasant surprise. A bad one can make your heart jump - like a loud sound behind you.
- And if the surprise is very big, very strong, we can say shocked.
- Yes, shocked is powerful. Your brain stops for a second.
- Okay, now let's move to another feeling - confused.
- Okay...next one - confused. Haha.
- Confused? Oh yeah, I know that feeling!
- Yeah! Confused is when your thoughts feel messy. Like ... everything is mixed up in your head.
- Messy thoughts - oh, totally!
- I feel confused when I open a new app and I don't know where to click.
- Haha, same here!
- I just stare at the screen... uh... and think, "What do I do?"
- Haha, yeah, just staring!
- Confused, confused.
- Haha, yes! I feel confused when someone explains something too fast. I hear the words, but my brain says, "Wait... what?"
- And sometimes confusion can lead to another feeling - lonely.
- Yes. Lonely is a quiet feeling. You can be surrounded by people and still feel lonely inside.
- That's true, Lucas. I sometimes feel lonely when everyone is busy, and I just want to talk.
- Yeah, I get that. That's why connection is so important. And connection leads us to a warmer feeling - hopeful.
- Hopeful is beautiful. It means you believe something good is coming. Even if today is hard, your heart says, "Tomorrow can be better."
- I love that, Mizu. I feel hopeful when I see progress, even small progress.
- And when progress happens, we often feel proud.
- Yes. Proud is warm and strong. I feel proud when I finish something I almost gave up on.
- Oh wow, me too. I feel proud of our listeners when they keep learning, even when English feels difficult.
- Now... let's talk about a feeling that makes us laugh later - embarrassed (xấu hổ, ngượng ngùng).
- Haha, yes. Embarrassed is uncomfortable, but very human.
- I feel embarrassed when I wave at someone who isn't actually waving at me. My face gets hot - embarrassed, embarrassed.
- Oh no, that happened to me too! I wanted to disappear, haha.
- And finally, let's end with a calm one - bored.
- Bored is when time feels slow. Your body is fine, but your mind says, "There's nothing to do."
- Yes. Bored is quiet, empty, not excited at all.
- And look at all these feelings - surprised, confused, lonely, hopeful, proud, embarrassed, bored.
- Different moments, different emotions, all connected - just like real life, and just like real English.
- Okay...Lucas, can I ask you something? Haha.
- Uh-oh... that sounds serious. Haha. What is it?
- Have you ever looked at someone and thought, "Hmm...I want that"?
- Haha, oh yes! Like, "Why do they have it?"
- Right? And you're smiling...but inside you're like "Hmmmmmm...."
- Haha, yeah! That little feeling.
- That feeling is called jealous.
- Jealous - oh yeah, I know that one.
- How about you? Have you ever felt jealous of someone?
- Ah, jealous. That's a tricky one.
- Yes. Jealous is when you compare yourself to others. Like when you see someone doing something you wish you could do.
- You smile...but inside, you feel jealous.
- That's very honest, Mizu. And it's normal sometimes. But we can change that feeling into something healthier - impressed.
